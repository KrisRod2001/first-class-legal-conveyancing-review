        <h2>Comprehensive Conveyancing Solutions: From Start to Finish</h2>
        <p>First Class Legal provides end-to-end conveyancing for both buyers and sellers, tailored to Victoria and Queensland’s unique regulations. Their services cover critical tasks to ensure compliance and efficiency.</p>
        <p><strong>Contract Preparation and Review</strong></p>
        <p>For sellers, they craft meticulous Vendor’s Statements (Section 32 in Victoria), ensuring all disclosures—title, easements, zoning—are accurate to prevent sale voids. For buyers, they review contracts pre-signing, flagging risks like undisclosed covenants. This dual focus is vital in markets where errors can cost 5-10% of property value.</p>
        <p><strong>Title and Property Searches</strong></p>
        <p>They conduct extensive searches via Landata (Victoria) and Titles Queensland, checking for mortgages, caveats, or planning restrictions. These searches, completed swiftly, protect clients from surprises like flood zone limitations, especially relevant in Queensland’s coastal areas.</p>
        <p><strong>Finance and Stakeholder Coordination</strong></p>
        <p>Liaising with lenders and other parties, they align finance approvals with settlement timelines. In 2025’s 6% interest rate environment, this coordination prevents delays, ensuring deposits (often $100,000+) are secure.</p>
        <p><strong>Rate Adjustments and Settlements</strong></p>
        <p>They handle precise adjustments for council rates, water, and taxes, using PEXA for accuracy. Settlements are executed electronically, transferring titles instantly and reducing errors by 90% per industry data.</p>
        <p><strong>Post-Settlement Notifications</strong></p>
        <p>They notify authorities like councils and utilities of ownership changes, preventing billing errors. This is crucial for sellers avoiding post-sale liabilities or buyers ensuring clean records.</p>
        <p><strong>Specialized Support</strong></p>
        <p>From off-the-plan purchases to investment properties, they offer tailored advice, navigating GST or foreign buyer rules. For example, a seller in Toorak benefits from their expertise in auction contracts, while a Queensland investor gets clarity on body corporate disclosures.</p>

        <h2>Innovative Technology: Real-Time Insights for Your Transaction</h2>
        <p>First Class Legal’s technology, highlighted by PEXA integration, offers clients a portal to track progress—contract status, search results, settlement dates—in real time. This transparency is a game-changer in 2025, where 20% of settlements face delays (REIV data). Their system ensures secure data handling, compliant with Australia’s Privacy Act 1988, with no third-party sharing.</p>
        <p>For instance, a seller in Brisbane can check mortgage discharge status via their phone, while a Melbourne buyer monitors finance approvals. This tech reduces manual errors and aligns with modern expectations for digital efficiency.</p>
